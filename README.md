# KCL-BFI PhD Prototype

This repository presents a proof-of-concept prototype developed to support my application for the fully funded AHRC Collaborative Doctoral Partnership between **King‚Äôs College London** and the **British Film Institute (BFI)**.

The project explores how **cloud-based computer vision tools** can be used to extract, analyze, and visualize metadata from **UK television adverts**, aligning with the PhD project titled:

**‚ÄúFrom narratives of value to valuable algorithms: a decade of promotional screen culture in the UK seen by machine.‚Äù**
